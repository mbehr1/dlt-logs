## Overview

In general DLT-Filter can be used to:
- add messages passing the filter to the current view (`positive`)
- remove messages passing the filter from the current view (`negative`)
- mark messages passing the filter with a specific background color (`marker`).

Additionally they can be used to:
- generate events (`event`) that are used to 
  - generate a graphical report or
  - used for **timesync** feature to synchronise time stamps between logs.

For generation reports from filters see [features: report generation](reports.md).

### When is a DLT message shown in a view?

The rules that determine whether a message is shown are similar to DLT-Viewer:

1. If no filter is active all messages are shown.
2. If no positive filter is active all messages are shown that are not filtered out by negative filters.
3. If any positive filter is active only those messages passing:
  - any (`or`) of the positive filters `and`
  - are not filtered out by any of the negative filters.

### Filter match attributes

A filter has the following attributes that determine the matching criteria:

attribute name | expected type | default value | description
-------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---
`type`| number | none | Mandatory type. Use `0` for positive, `1` for negative, `2` for marker and `3` for event based filter.
`mstp`| number | undefined | Message type. `0` for `TYPE_LOG`, `1`for `TYPE_APP_TRACE`, `2` for `TYPE_NW_TRACE`, `3` for `TYPE_CONTROL`.
`ecu`| string | undefined| ECU identifier / ECU. Up to 4 characters.
`ecuIsRegex` | boolean | no value = 'autodetect' | Optional. See `apidIsRegex`.
`apid`| string | undefined| Application identifier / APID . Up to 4 characters.
`apidIsRegex` | boolean | no value = 'autodetect' | Optional. If provided the apid is treated according to the value as true:regex, false:no regex. If not provided the apid is treated as regex if it contains any special regex characters: `^$*+?()[]{}\|.-\=!<,`
`ctid`| string | undefined| Context identifier / CTID. Up to 4 characters.
`ctidIsRegex` | boolean | no value = 'autodetect' | Optional. See `apidIsRegex`.
`logLevelMin`| number | undefined| Minimum log-level. I.e. log-level of the message has to be >= to match. If specified `mstp`is automatically set to 0. See [Log levels](#log-levels) for values and examples.
`logLevelMax`| number | undefined| Same as `logLevelMin`but for the maximum log-level, i.e. log-level of the message has to be `<= logLevelMax` to match. See [Log levels](#log-levels) for values and examples.
`verbose`| boolean | undefined| `verbose` or `non-verbose` messages. Verbose flag is part of the extended header of a DLT msg and defaults to false if the ext. header doesn't exist.
`payload`| string |undefined| String that is searched in the (textual) representation of the message payload. Matches if the string is contained within the payload.
`payloadRegex`|string | undefined| Regular expression that the full (textual) representation of the message payload has to match against. This is in general faster than payload if e.g. `^` for the begin of the text is used. E.g. `^Exception:` is faster than `payload`=`"Exception:"` as the search can be stopped at the first characters already if the payload doesn't start with "Exc..."
`ignoreCasePayload`| boolean | false | Determines whether payload or payloadRegex is using case sensitive (default) or `ignoring case` searches. With payload for case insensitive search both strings are converted to (ascii) upper case first. For regex the "i" option is used (javascript implementation) or (?i) (adlt/rust implementation).

:::note undefined attributes
Undefined attributes are ignored.

:::note all defined attributes need to match
For a message to match all defined attributes have to match (logical `and`). See `not` below to negate the match result.

:::tip Filter performance
In general all available log messages - which can easily be more than 10 million messages in larger log files - have to be matched against the filters.
To speed up the match-comparision it's usually a good practice to specify as many attributes as possible. E.g. typically `apid` and `ctid`.

`ecu` should only be used in cases when you deal with DLT-files that have multiple ECUs logs in the same file. See [configs](configsReference) for an alternative way to quickly disable filters not relevant for the current ECU.

For `apid` and `ctid` the regular expressions are roughly 6 times slower (e.g. 35ns vs 6ns) and should only be used if necessary.

Payload text checks should use `payloadRegex` instead of `payload` except for the cases where you really do want to search simply for substring somewhere in the payload. The amount of necessary steps during regex comparision are nicely shown on pages like [regex101](https://regex101.com).

E.g. to match for messages with

`Operation (any name) failed` but not `Operation (any name) succeeded` messages a regex like

`^Operation .*? failed` (53 steps) is faster than `Operation .* failed` (70 steps for 3 test strings).
:::

:::tip ecu, apid, ctid regular expressions
In general the filter for ecu, apid, ctid expect 4 characters. If less characters are used the regex search is different that the default/non-regex ones:
e.g.

version | example | description
------- | ------- | -----------
default | `"apid":"ECU"` | default/non-regex matches against `apid ECU\0`. So starting with ECU and then (null byte).
`"apidIsRegex":true`| `"apid":"ECU"` | regex matches against 'ECU' within apid. So e.g. "ECU1" or "AECU" or "ECU" all match.
regex | `"apid":"^ECU"` | autodetected regex matches against starting with 'ECU'. So e.g. "ECU" or "ECU1" match  but not "AECU".

:::

:::warning
Especially the `payloadRegex` consists frequently of characters that need to be escaped in JSON.
If using the DLT filter assistant to create filters this is done automatically. If you modify the JSON settings manually please keep this in mind and escape the strings properly.
You can use the following code snippet to quickly escape/unescape your string:

<EscapePayload />

### Additional filter attributes

Additionaly a filter has the following attributes:

attribute name | expected type | default value | description
-------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---
`name`| string | - | Optional name for the filter. If not specified an autogenerated name based on the attributes is used, see [autogenerated filter name](#how-to-interpret-the-autogenerated-filter-name). 
`enabled`| boolean | true | If this is set to `false` the filter will never match any message, i.e. is not active.
`not`| boolean | false | Negate the match result expect for `enabled`
`atLoadTime`| boolean | false | This filter is evaluated during initial file opening. This is useful to reduce the load times and size of large DLT-files. Any changes to the filter are only applied after the file is closed and newly opened.
`filterColour`| string or object | undefined| only for `type=2`(MARKER) or `type=0`(POSITIVE): If a string is provided it specifies the border color to be used for the marker. This can be any css color like `red` or hexadecimal color e.g. `#ff0000` (see e.g. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp)). To set other colors than the border color an object can be used. E.g. `{"backgroundColor":"blue"}`. See [decoration options](#decoration-options).
`decorationId`| string | undefined| only for `type=2`(MARKER) or `type=0`(POSITIVE). Specifies the "decorationId" to the be used for the marker. (Deprecated. Use `filterColour` object settings).
`timeSyncId`| string | undefined| only in conjunction with `payloadRegex`and `timeSyncPrio`. See [Time Sync](timeSync).
`timeSyncPrio`| number | undefined| only in conjunction with `timeSyncId`.
`reportOptions`|JSON object| undefined| see [Report generation](reports).
`configs`|JSON object|undefined| see [Configs](configsReference)

### Log levels

DLT specifies the following log-levels:

log-level | value
--------- | -----
`LOG_FATAL`| `1`
`LOG_ERROR`|`2`
`LOG_WARN`| `3`
`LOG_INFO`| `4`
`LOG_DEBUG`|`5`
`LOG_VERBOSE`|`6`

:::note
To add all messages with warnings, error or fatal messages use a positive filter with `logLevelMax = 3`.

To remove all messages with INFO, DEBUG or VERBOSE even from other matching filters add `negative`filter with `logLevelMin = 4`.
:::

### How to interpret the autogenerated filter name

The filter name shows the following information:
- `disabled`: if the filter is currently not enabled.
- name: the optional name attribute it available
- type: `+` (positive), `-` (negative), `*` (marker), `@` (event)
- `(load time)`: for load time filters
- `!`: for "not" / negate filter
- `mstp`: if specified
- `>= log-level`: if logLevelMin is specified
- `<= log-level`: if logLevelMax is specified
- `VERB`: if filter for verbose msgs is specified
- `NON-VERB`: if filter for non-verbose msgs is specified
- ECU:.., APID:..., CTID:...: if specified
- `payload contains '...'`: if payload is specified
- `payload matches '...'`: if payloadRegex is specified
- `in .. LCs`: if lifecycles is specified (todo see ...)
- `timeSyncId: ... prio:... `: if timeSync is specified. 

### decoration options

Filter markers can use the full color capabilities provided by the VS-Code API [DecorationRenderOptions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#DecorationRenderOptions).
Excerpt:

property | description
-------- | -----------
backgroundColor | Background color (as css color like for string based filterColour)
borderColor | Color of the border (used for string based filterColour). E.g. `"blue"`. Needs to be used with borderWidth and borderStyle together.
borderWidth | With of the border as CSS styling property. E.g. `"1px"`.
borderStyle | Style applied to the border. E.g. `"dotted"`.
color | Color of the text. E.g. `green`.
overviewRulerColor | Color of the decoration in the overview ruler.
overviewRulerLane | Lane to use. Possible values: 2 (center), 7 (full), 1 (left), 4 (right).

The `isWholeLine` property is automatically applied.

:::tip Color theme support
You can provide different settings for light and dark themes, e.g. `{"light":{...}, "dark":{...}}`.
:::

:::tip Overview ruler
If you provide the `overviewRulerColor` and `overviewRulerLane` properties the marker is visible in the overview ruler as well!
:::

Example:

```jsonc
"filterColour":{
  "backgroundColor":"yellow",
  "borderColor":"blue",
  "borderWidth":"2px",
  "borderStyle":"dotted",
  "color":"green",
  "overviewRulerLane":1, // left
  "overviewRulerColor":"yellow"
}
```
